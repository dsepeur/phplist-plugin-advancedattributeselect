phplist-plugin-advancedattributeselect
======================================

Segmentation of newsletter recipients by use of advanced attribute selection (e.g. Age)

Michiel Dethmers coded plugin simpleattributeselect to send emails to recipients based on attribute values.
I took the core code and build a "age range selector" into it. 
I plan to develop this tool further and maintain it. 

With this plugin, you can use a segmentation based on attributes and combine them.
My nice contribution to the source plugin is the use of age range calculation made based 
on the birthdate of newsletter-recipients
